# Computer-Security-Network-Design-and-ACL-Policy-Implementation-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
A network topology is designed in Cisco Packet Tracer with routers with point-to-point connections between them, a number of switches, and end devices connected to each switch. Then a simple security policy is implemented using ACLs. The video presentation and Cisco Packet Tracer file (.pkt) is attached in the repository.

Video presentation of this project can be found in the link below.
